## What I've learned from building this project

#### Product vision

Think first about the final feature rather than developping cool but useless stuff.

#### Backward compatibility

Think of the application, the code and the way it works, in such a way to ensure that functionnality is always compatible as the application is developed.

#### Optimization

Optimize image display and the number of API calls to save time in displaying and running the desired information.

#### Scripting (scrapping & parsing)

Retrieve elements from other websites, analyze and manipulate them to retrieve the desired information.

#### API analysis

Analyze public APIs from other websites to identify patterns that can be reused and exploited for the application's operation.
